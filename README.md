# KMNIST_dataset
This repository is just an alternative source to download the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset. Due to issues with other sources, I searched the dataset that works and have thus provided it for further use. The whole dataset is a work by Deep Learning for Classical Japanese Literature. Tarin Clanuwat et al. arXiv:1812.01718.
